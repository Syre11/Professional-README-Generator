# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

This project generates a ReadMe.md file based on your answers to the prompts. This project was built to be a quick and easy way to create a ReadMe file for any given project. I learned a lot about using javascript in a command line interface, specifically learning how to prompt the user and how to use the input.

## Installation

To use this ReadMe generator you will need to git clone the repo to your local machine. 

Run npm install inquirer to install the needed package dependencies.

Run the application by typing node index.js in the command line.

## Usage

![App usage](./walkthrough/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif)

Answer the prompt questions to the end and your README file will be generated.

## Credits
